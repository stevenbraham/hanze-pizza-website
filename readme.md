For a school assignment we had to make a small web app where people can order pizza online.

As an extra challenge I have created my own mvc framework.  Unfortunately school would't provide us with a working MySQL database, so the database models are classes that simulate database calls.

My "framework" itself is contained in the framework folder and `Framework` namespace. The application lives in the app folder and `App` namespace.

Because the assignment is about PHP code, I haven't really paid much attention to design.

All code is explained in the code files themselves.
